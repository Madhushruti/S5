Assignment S5

#Goal	:
To create Basic skeleton of a Model with systematic Layers & Maxpooling defined.Additionally defined the skeleton of the code to incorporate various Print statemetns that would help to capture Model performance at every Epoch.
#Params	4,10,890
#Best Train Accuracy	
99.94
#Best Test Accuracy	
98.99
#Observation/ Analysis/Conclusion
The Model is overall decent Model. By that we mean, at few of the places test accuracy is GREATER THAN Train accuracy. And most of the Epochs model is Not Overfitting
#Comment	:
We can Proceed confidently to continue to improve this model.
