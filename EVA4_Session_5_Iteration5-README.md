#Goal	
In Last attempt the final model was very good  because of the CONSISTENCY in the Training and Test Accuracy difference. But no where close to Target Accuracy.
The goal is still to  achieve  99.4 % target accuracy. Intentend of this model to extend previous model and try and use DropOut.
DropOut has the effect of reducing the capacity or thinning the network during training. When we use Dropout in a network, randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. They are “dropped-out” randomly. 

It's a regularization method, which  reduces over-fitting by adding a penalty to the loss function.

#Observation/ Analysis/Conclusion	

This is really very GOOD Model. With consistent Train and test Accuracy.
The model does not have overfitting issue, but the target is still not matched.
In order for model to perfrom better learning, we could try increasing the capacity of model.

Why do we want to increase the Model capacity at this stage? Because the currently trained model is very consistant in 
Learning and does not suffer from Overfitting. We have managed to train a Stable Model.
